        TO DO / KNOWN ISSUES
/*********************************************/

If you are downloading the source from github (as opposed to one of the prepackaged downloads available there), you will need to download and copy the php-ncstate class into this module's directory as well.

	Instructions:
	1. Go to https://github.com/ncsuwebdev/PHP-Ncstate and download the package
	2. Extract and copy the files into the ncstatebrandingbar/library directory, so that your path looks like this:
		<site root>/sites/all/modules/ncstatebrandingbar/library/php-ncstate/Ncstate
		
	In future, this will be automated, but for now you have to take this extra step.
